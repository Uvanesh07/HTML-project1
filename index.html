    <h2>WHAT IS HTML</h2>
    
    <p ><ul >
        <li id="ww">HTML(Hyper-Text Markup Language) is the most basic building block of
        all web pages.</li>
        <li id="ww"> It provides structure to the content appearing on a website, such as
        images, text, or videos by creating a basic skeleton.</li>
        <li id="ww"> HTML is still very useful today, the reason being no matter the
        framework or language we use to develop the web page, the output
        would be rendered in HTML.</li>
       <h3>HTML Basics</h3>
       <li id="ww">HTML A Practical Guide</li> 
        <li id="ww">
         HTML is a standard defined by the WHATWG, an acronym for Web Hypertext
        Application Technology Working Group, an organization formed by people working
        on the most popular web browser. This means it's basically controlled by Google,
        Mozilla, Apple, and Microsoft.</li>
         <li id="ww">In the past the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) was the organization in charge of
        creating the HTML standard.</li>
        <li id="ww">The control informally moved from W3C to WHATWG when it became clear that the
        W3C push towards XHTML was not a good idea</li>

    <h2>HTML VERSION</h2>
    <P><UL>
        <LI id="ww">We had HTML version 1 in 1993.</LI>
       <li id="ww">   HTML 2 followed in 1995.</li>   
           
            
            
        <LI id="ww">  We got HTML 3 in January 1997, and HTML 4 in December 1997.</LI>
        <LI id="ww">HTML5 is a term that now defines a whole set of technologies, which
            includes HTML but adds a lot of APIs and standards like WebGL, SVG,
            and more.</LI>

       <li id="ww">  It can be generated by a JavaScript client-side application that generates

        <LI id="ww"> In the simplest case, it can be stored in a file and served to the browser by a

    <h2>HTML PAGE STRUCTURE</h2>
    
<P>Modern HTML uses this doctype:
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    Then we have the html element, which has an opening and closing tag:
    Most tags come in pairs with an opening tag and a closing tag. The closing tag is written the same as
    the opening tag, but with a /:
    There are a few self-closing tags, which means they don't need a separate closing tag as they don't
    contain anything in them.
    </P>
    The HTML starting tag is used at the beginning of the document,
right after the document type declaration.
<li id="ww">The HTML ending tag is the last thing present in an HTML
document.</li>
<li id="ww">Inside the HTML element we have 2 elements: head and body:</li>
<li id="ww"> Inside the head, we will have tags that are essential to creating a
web page, like the title, the metadata, and internal or external
CSS and JavaScript. Mostly things that do not directly appear on
the page, but only help the browser (or bots like the Google
search bot) display it properly.</li>
<li id="ww"> Inside the body we will have the content of the page. The visible
stuff</li>
             <p id="topmenu"><a href="#topmenu">GO TO TOP</a></p> 
            </section>
    <section id=section3>
        <h2>TAG VS ELEMENT</h2>
        <p>
        Elements have a starting tag and a closing tag. In this example, we use the p starting
        and closing tags to create a p element:
        <!-- <p>A paragraph of text</p> -->
        So, an element constitutes the whole package:
        <li id="ww"> starting tag</li>
        <li id="ww"> text content (and possibly other elements)</li>
        <li id="ww"> closing tag</li>
        If an element has doesn't have a closing tag, it is only written with the starting tag, and it 
        cannot contain any text content.
    </p>
        <p id="topmenu"><a href="#topmenu">GO TO TOP</a></p> 
    </section>
    <section id=section4>
        <h2>HTML ATTRIBUTES</h2>
        <P>The starting tag of an element can have special snippets of information we can attach,
            called attributes. Attributes have the key="value" syntax:
            <p class="a-class">A paragraph of text</p>
            The class and id attributes are two of the most common you will find used.
            They have a special meaning, and they are useful both in CSS and JavaScript.
            The difference between the two is that an id is unique in the context of a web page; it
            cannot be duplicated. Classes, on the other hand, can appear multiple times on multiple
            elements.
            Plus, an id is just one value. A class can hold multiple values, separated by a space.
            <p class="a-class another-class">A paragraph of text</p>
            
        </P>

        <h2>CASE INSENSITIVE</h2>
        <p>HTML is case insensitive. Tags can be written in all caps, or lowercase. In the
            early days, caps were the norm. Today lowercase is the norm. It is a
            convention.
            You usually write like this:
            <p>A paragraph of text</p>
            not like this:
            <P>A paragraph of text</P>
            </p>

<section id=section6>
    <h2>!DOCTYPE</h2>
    <P>The <!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps
        browsers to
        <li id="ww"> display web pages correctly.</li>
        <li id="ww">It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).</li>
        <li id="ww"> The <!DoCtYpE> declaration is not case sensitive.</li>
        <li id="ww" >The <!DOCTYPE> declaration for HTML5 is <!DOCTYPE html></li>

    <h2>HELLO HTML</h2>
    <P>HTML is a Hyper Text Markup Language, which used for web designing, web applications. HTML is first to step to learn web application development. 
        It’s not the same as other programming languages like Python, Java etc. In this tutorial, we will see “HTML Hello World Example”.</P>

    <h2>COMMENT AND PARAGRAPH</h2>
    <H3>comment</H3>
    <P>The comment tag (<!– Comment –>) is used to insert comments in the HTML code. It is a good practice of coding so that coder and the reader
     can get help to understand the code. 
    It is helpful to understand the complex code. The comment tag is useful during the debugging of codes.</P>
   <h3>paragraph</h3><p>A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after 
    a paragraph.</p>

    <h2>LINK</h2>
    <P><li id="ww"> Hyperlinks are one of the most exciting innovations the Web has to offer.</li>
        <li id="ww">They've been a feature of the Web since the beginning, and are what makes the Web
            a web. Hyperlinks allow us to link documents to other documents or resources, link to
            specific parts of documents, or make apps available at a web address.</li>
        <li id="ww">Almost any web content can be converted to a link so that when clicked or otherwise
            activated the web browser goes to another web address (URL).
            </li>

<section id=section12>
    <h2>IMAGE</h2>
    <P>
        <li id="ww">Use clear link wording
        </li>
        <li id="ww">Don't repeat the URL as part of the link text — URLs look ugly, and sound even uglier
            when a screen reader reads them out letter by letter.</li>
        <li id="ww"> Don't say "link" or "links to" in the link text — it's just noise. Screen readers tell
            people there's a link. Visual users will also know there's a link, because links are
            generally styled in a different color and underlined (this convention generally
            shouldn't be broken, as users are used to it).</li>
        <li id="ww" >Keep your link text as short as possible — this is helpful because screen readers need
            to interpret the entire link </li>
